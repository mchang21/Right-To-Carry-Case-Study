# Right To Carry Case Study

This is a group project for COGS 137 - Practical Data Science in R

## Introduction

In this case study, we seek to analyze the effect of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates from linear regression models when analyzing right to carry laws and violence rates. In the United States of America, the issue of gun violence has consistently become a controversial issue considering how impactful misusage has been since the inception of this country. Such misusages have included school shootings, shootings at festivals/clubs, and general gun violence out in the public streets. As such to prevent such atrocities from occurring, attempts have been made to minimize this through Right to Carry (RTC) Laws. Such laws are laws that "specifies if an how citizens are allowed to have a firearm on their person or nearby (for example, in a citizen's car) in public" (Slide 4, CS02: Right-To-Carry (Data)).

Such laws are created and carried out at the US state level. The only federal law regarding the right to keep and bear arms is our Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights which was ratified in 1791 (Slide 5, CS02: Right-To-Carry (Data)). A time period where muskets would be easily outclassed by our current firearm models. There are no such laws for carrying firearms in the public. Furthermore, severity for such laws vary greatly  between states regarding the right to carry firearms. For example, some states such as California require extensive effort to obtain a permit to legally carry a firearm, whereas other states like Arizona allows individuals to carry concealed firearms for lawful purposes without a permit. There are also other  states who meet at a middle ground and grants permits to carry a firearm upon the completion of specified requirements (Slide 5, CS02: Right-To-Carry (Data)). Analyzing the effect of  multicollinearity on coefficient estimates from our linear regression models may serve to give us a better understanding of what kind of role a certain variable may play.

## Task

Analyze the impact of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates in linear regression models assessing the relationship between Right to Carry (RTC) laws and gun violence rates across U.S. states.

## Question

What is the effect of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates from linear regression models when analyzing right to carry laws and violence rates?

## Data Set

The dataset that we will be using for our case study is sourced from two contradictory analyses. The first is from John J. Donohue et al., in their analysis Right-to-Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State-Level Synthetic Control Analysis. The second is from David B. Mustard & John Lott and their analysis Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns. Coase-Sandor Institute for Law & Economics Working Paper No. 41.
